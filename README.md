# Proyecto-Epilepsia

## Installation and initial configuration

The project uses a Docker Compose file to orchestrate all its necessary components. Docker Compose will initialize and configure containers for each necessary service with minimal user intervention.

### Step 1: Requirements

Downloading the repository will be easier with Git installed. To download Git, go to the following site:

- https://git-scm.com


The user must have the **Docker Engine** and **Docker Compose** running on their machine. This can be verified by running `docker compose version`. Should the output not be something similar to `Docker Compose version v2.21.0`, the user must verify that both Docker Engine and Docker Compose are correctly installed in their machine. Docker Engine and Compose is included with typical Docker Desktop installations, or can be installed standalone.

[Instructions to install Docker Desktop \(Recommended for Windows and Mac users\)](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

[Instructions to install Docker Engine (Recommended for Linux and WSL users)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

[Instructions to install Docker Compose for Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Step 2: Clone repository

Download the repository

- Go to the terminal (If you are not acquainted with this term, feel free to look it by yourself)

- git clone https://github.com/SELF-Software-Evolution-Lab/AI-Epilepsy.git

### Step 3: Run the Docker Compose file

Within the user's terminal that has access to `docker compose`, the user should run the following command:

- `docker-compose up`

[optional] If a specific docker compose .yml file should be used instead of the existing `docker-compose.yml`, the command should instead be `docker compose -f {CUSTOM_DOCKER_COMPOSE}.yml up`

[optional] If the user wants to leave the services running in the background, and not have them terminate upon closing the active terminal window, they must add a `-d` flag to the end of the command.

### Step 4: Creating fake initial data

This step is **optional**. To populate the database with example data, follow these instructions:

1) Install Node.js on your machine. LTS versions are recommended (20.10.0 at the time of writing). [Download links can be found here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
2) Navigate to the backend folder using the command `cd bkAIEp/` and run the following terminal command: `npm i` to install all required dependencies.
3) Run the following command: `npm run cli -- --seeder -d`

### Step 5: accessing the AI-Epilepsy service

Using a web browser, navigate to http://localhost:5002

Congrats, you finally made it ðŸŽ‰

### Step 6: turning off all services

In the root folder of the project, run the following command:

`docker-compose down`

## Optional configuration

The Docker Compose template will run the project using default local-oriented values. If the user needs to modify some of these values, they will have to create a `.env` file between Step 2 and Step 3.

Copy the existing `.env` file template:

`cp .env.template .env`

Edit the desired values within the `.env` file using a text editor

`nano .env`, `vim .env`, etc.

Finally, you can continue running the `docker-compose.yml` file as demonstrated in Step 3




## Technologies 

### JWT - Middleware

JWT, which stands for JSON Web Token, is a security pattern commonly used for authentication and authorization in web development. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. JWTs are often used to secure the transmission of information between parties in a way that can be verified and trusted.

JWTs allow for stateless authentication, meaning that the server does not need to store the user's session information. Instead, the necessary information is contained within the JWT itself. This aligns well with the nature of middleware in Express, where each request can be independently processed.

Therefore, it was implemented via authMiddleware, where you would see its validation and management

it is important to include JWT_SECRET on your .env file to change the default secret

### sequelize

Sequelize is a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js, designed to work with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MSSQL. ORM libraries provide a higher-level abstraction over databases, allowing developers to interact with databases using JavaScript or TypeScript code instead of raw SQL queries. Sequelize facilitates database operations by providing an easy-to-use API and a set of features for defining models, relationships, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

As part of the actualization it was opted to use a ORM and due to its popularity and maintainability sequelize was the go to

as for the .env

DB_HOST for host
DB_NAME for name of the db
DB_USERNAME for the user
DB_PASSWORD for the user

### bcryptjs

As for the storing of passwords it was decided to go with bcryptjs to hash the password and storing it 

### chalk

It is use to gif color to some consoles, mainly on cli script

### cors

To avoid CORS error

### dotenv

To load environment variables

### moment

for extended date management

## ora

For interactive consoles


## Scripts

### cli - backend

#### --factory

It is for creating the files following file system

npm run cli -- --factory -d? -r? -c? -s? -m? --seeder? -n <name>

-n <name> it is the name of the files to be created

-d is the same than sending  -r? -c? -s? it would create the files for route, controller and service for the -n (name) given

-r it would create a route for the -n (name) given and change the index.ts for routes import
-c it would create a controller for the -n (name) given
-s it would create a service for the -n (name) given 
-m it would create a model for the -n (name) given and change the index.ts for models import
--seeder it would create a seeder on bkAIEp/src/seeders

Example

npm run cli -- --factory -d -m -n message

this would create route, controller, service and model call messages

#### --seeder

--seeder <name>? -x? -d? -f?

<name> Name of the seeder to be run
-x if you want to run them all
-d for running development seeders
-f to force the running (use it under you own responsibility)

Example

npm run cli -- --seeder initSeeder -f

this would run the seeder name initSeeder located in bkAIEp/src/seeders/initSeeder.ts and it is going to run forced, therefor, even if this was run before it would be rerun
