# Retraining and evaluation of machine learning and deep learning models for seizure classification from EEG data
In this repository you will find additional information, the scpits used and the final models associated with this publication (Under review).
## Folders:
* Models: In this folder you will find two of the best performing models together with a file to perform the previous data transformation (Scaler). The remaining four models can be found at https://zenodo.org/records/13954227.
* Scripts: All .py files used during our research:
  * DLModels: Scripts for the trainig and testing of Deep Learning models.
  * MLModels: Scripts for the trainig and testing of calssical machine Learning models
  * Feature calculation: Scripts for feature extraction for later classical machine learning models training.
  * Others: Contains script for data preprocessing, ROC curve calculation and dependencies used for all scripts.
* NewData: Scripts for Seizure detection in new .edf files using best performance model (CNN1).
